The beginning of my journey in medicine began when I was very young. After witnessing several members of my family decline due to Alzheimer’s and various cancers, I became passionate about helping others like them. Years later, I began college and met a life-long friend. My friend is burdened with multiple incurable diseases, and during my time living with her, I had an intimate view of what it is like to truly suffer and battle through healthcare’s inefficient and harmful systems.

Throughout this same time, I held various medical positions. As I witnessed people lie miserably in hospital beds while we “treated” them, I was reminded of my loved ones. I knew there had to be a better way to provide proper medical care, and I couldn’t stop myself from imagining how to do so.

Outside of the hospital, I worked towards another passion: research. Through various opportunities in college, I realized how much I enjoyed translational research and began working at Oregon Health and Science University’s neuroscience institute after graduation. While there, my favorite task analyzing my experimental data. I thrived once my experiments were complete, giving me the chance to find the story hidden beneath the numbers and organize it into clear figures. By working with data, I discovered that numbers and figures help to show the big picture, and oftentimes make plain to us what once was a mystery. 

Combined, my experiences have shown me that one way to address the underlying issues residing in healthcare- and the avenue I am most excited about- is through data. Because of this, I have decided to end my pursuit of medicine and instead become a data scientist. My story has prepared me in such a way that has given me a clear mission for work, an insider’s perspective of the problems I seek to solve, and a heart dedicated to serving those in need. The answers to the world’s most pressing issues in healthcare are out there; I am convinced the secrets lie in data, and I am thrilled to be searching for them.
