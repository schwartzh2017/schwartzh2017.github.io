In my roles at [Main Street Family Medicine](https://www.mainstreetfamilymed.com/) and [New Heights Clinic](https://newheights.org/new-heights-clinic/), I compared patient demographics between the two clinics to better inform our leadership on how to care for both populations and grow each clinic separately. 

The New Heights Clinic uses paper charts, and I was fortunate enough to have multiple volunteers help me manually collect information from a representative random sample of paper charts. Main Street Family Medicine uses an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) with very limited data capabilities, so I crafted work-arounds to generate as much data as I could despite the vast limitations. I started the presenation with simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of both clinics, then turned to a statistical comparision between the two. The results gave us insight on how the two clinics differ from each other so we could know what their unique needs are and how to grow as a result.  

The below presentation has been modified to protect patient and business information. I left out the slides discussing my conclusions and recommendations for the future of both clinics.
