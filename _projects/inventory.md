In my role at [Main Street Family Medicine](https://www.mainstreetfamilymed.com/), I created an application for our nurses to keep better track of our medications stored in-house. The app also features an option to predict which medicaions would be the best to re-order at any given time. This is based on our current inventory, dispense history, and other data concerning our current patient base. The prediction feature saves our nurses time it would otherwise take them to manually determine which medications they need to order. 

To demonstrate the application, I created a near-duplicate using randomly-generated data. 

COMING SOON: Click [here]() to view the application and [here]() for the sample repo.
