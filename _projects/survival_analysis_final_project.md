Data from: [A. Ait, J. L. C. Izquierdo and J. Cabot, "An Empirical Study on the Survival Rate of GitHub Projects," 2022 IEEE/ACM 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 2022, pp. 365-375, doi: 10.1145/3524842.3527941.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796216)


My partner, [Nick Brooks](https://nickbrooks-ds.github.io/), and I worked together to analyze data from ["An Empirical Study on the Survival Rate of GitHub Projects,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796216) to investigate survivability of GitHub repositories. We created KM curves, fit out data to various custom models, discovered traits of surviving repositories, and predicted the mean lifetime of repos based on those traits. Please see our [code](https://github.com/schwartzh2017/Survival_Project3) and [Google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ihUJ366En04LmeBpgqHGs5y6o8plJnn4DxuPwu6vbLs/edit?usp=sharing) for more details. See below for a few sample images from our presentation.
