In my role at [Main Street Family Medicine](https://www.mainstreetfamilymed.com/), I created an application to genearte monthly reports. I wrote scripts for easily extracting data from our Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and re-running pertinent analyses each month. Using tools such as RStudio and Shiny, I merged these reports into a publishable (yet password-protected) application for internal sharing. The report includes both patient and business data. Work with patient data is helpful to both our nurse practitioner students as they work on their doctorate projects and the rest of our staff as we continually seek to provide relevant and effective care for our patients. The rest of the data provides opportunites to make well-informed business decisions for the future of our clinic.

Watch the demonstration below for a look at how a user can navigate the application and gain insightful data from it. Please note that several reports are concealed from this demonstration for patient and business confidentiality reasons.

When a user navigates to the web application, they are first prompted to enter the password. With the correct password, the app automatically navigates to the second page, titled "PPD Plot." This stands for "Patients per Provider per Day", which has helped us to keep track of how each provider's patient panels have grown so we can know when to on-board new providers and other staff. 

The second report title is hidden. The video shows the title of the third report ("Monthly Revenue Plots"), but the actual plots are not shown. This data has guided us through decisions concerning patient and company relationships, when to pause enrollment, how closed enrollment impacted our company, and when to open enrollment again.

The fourth report details the insurance status of our patients. This led us to begin collecting insurance information from our patients as the report revealed how most patients' status was unknown. As we gather their insurance statuses, we are able to target specific resources for our patients (ex: which hospital systems accept which insurances for which referral specialties, what our cash pay options are for our uninsured patients, etc).

The title of the fifth report is "Patient Demographics and Conditions," but the report itself is not shown for confidentiality reasons. This data has guided us to create free programs and resources designed for the unique needs of our patient population. The final report title is also hidden.
