In my role at [Main Street Family Medicine](https://www.mainstreetfamilymed.com/), I created an application to genearte monthly reports. I wrote scripts for easily extracting data from our Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and re-running pertinent analyses each month. Using tools such as RStudio and Shiny, I merged these reports into a publishable (yet password-protected) application for internal sharing. The report includes both patient and business data. Work with patient data is helpful to both our nurse practitioner students as they work on their doctorate projects and the rest of our staff as we continually seek to provide relevant and effective care for our patients. The rest of the data provides opportunites to make well-informed business decisions for the future of our clinic.

To demonstrate the application, I created a near-duplicate using randomly-generated data. I included most of the reports except for a few due to confidentiality reasons. I also removed the password feature. Most reports are self-explanatory, apart from the one I titled "PPD." This stands for "Patients per Provider per Day", which has helped us to keep track of how each provider's patient panels have grown so we can know when to on-board new providers and other staff.
