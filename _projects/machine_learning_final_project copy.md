Data from: [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=any&sort=runs&id=40536)


My partners, [Christy Lawrence](https://cml-data.github.io/), Noelle Matthews, and I worked together to analyze data from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=any&sort=runs&id=40536) to determine what traits, if any, predict whether or not a couple will match after a speed dating round. We found the most important features in couples matching using preprocessors such as OneHotEncoder and StandardScaler, created ensemble models to predict which couples would match, and ran our data through unsupervised models like PCA and Kmeans to further refine our results. Please see our [code](https://github.com/schwartzh2017/Machine_learning_final_project) for more details. See below for a few sample images from our presentation.
